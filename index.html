<p><i>Materia Medica</i> is the body of knowledge concerning the medicinal
properties mainly of plants, but also of animals and minerals – the so-called
‘simples’ – that in the past formed the raw matter for the making of medicinal
remedies. The expression derives from the Latin title of the massive
compilation put together by the physician and botanist Dioscorides (De
Materia Medica libri sex, 1st century CE).</p>

<<p>This website stems from the Project MAT-MED in Transit. The
Transforming Knowledge of Healing Plants 1 with the primary aim of
disseminating bits of knowledge on plants (mainly) for raising/enhancing the
current awareness of the value of Nature as a resource and a source of
beauty in our everyday life.</p>

<<p>Our early modern ancestors were much more familiar than we are today
with materia medica, and were used to manipulating many medicinal
remedies by themselves drawing substances from the surrounding
environment. Professionals such as physicians and apothecaries, but also
many ordinary people, were keen to discover the new therapeutic properties
of local plants as well as being passionate about knowing (and cultivating)
new plants coming from the Far East, North Africa and the recently
discovered New World.</p>
